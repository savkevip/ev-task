#Description:

this is small app about account details...

#TechStack:

`React, Redux, React Router` - For representing data to view, state manging and app navigation.
`Saga` - Is my choice for async calls
`Ramda` - For immutability,
`syled-components` - Maybe I didn't use full potential of this library but I think is so cool thing,
`prop-types` - For type checking,
`jest, enzyme, mock...` - For unit tests (tests for sure do not cover all cases but those are just some basics)
`Create React App and Bootstrap` - I used this two to cut my time for setting build/style app.
